# Project File — Navigation Guide

## What Lives Here

Team memory and coordination documents. This is the shared brain across Claude, Mistral,
and Grok. Read before starting any session to understand the current project state.

## Founders Visionary Folder

`Founders Visonary Folder/` — the vision + decision layer:

- `ACTIVE/` — live planning documents and open questions (read all before major decisions)
- `SKILLS/` — 11 proven skill docs (workflow patterns that worked; now formalized in `.claude/commands/`)
- `VISION/` — long-term vision documents (Arcane Tab Magic System, etc.)
- `MODIFICATIONS/` — proposed changes to the architecture
- `TEMPLATES/` — templates for new questions, visions, modifications

## Writing to This Folder

- New session logs go into the appropriate `*_memory.md` file
- New open questions → `ACTIVE/` using `TEMPLATES/question-template.md`
- New vision → `VISION/` using `TEMPLATES/vision-template.md`
- Resolved questions → move from `ACTIVE/` to `ANSWERED/`
- Never edit another agent's memory file — only your own
